# models.py
# ------------------------------------
# This file defines the database models for the Flask application.
# It will be used to create and manage the database tables needed
# for storing user data, transactions, budgets, and any other
# relevant information.
#
# Each model in this file will correspond to a table in the database.
# For example, the "User" model will represent a "users" table, and
# the "Transaction" model will represent a "transactions" table.
#
# When we get to the stage of integrating a database, we will use
# an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like SQLAlchemy to
# map these Python classes to database tables and to interact with
# the data through Python code.
#
# To create the database tables and interact with the database:
# - Define your models in this file.
# - Use 'db.create_all()' to create the tables in the database.
# - Use SQLAlchemy to query, insert, update, or delete records in
#   the database.
#
# Example Models:
# - User: Represents users of the app.
# - Transaction: Represents individual bank transactions.
# - Budget: Represents budget categories and spending limits.
#
# For now, we are leaving this as a placeholder until we integrate
# a database like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
