# forms.py
# ------------------------------------
# This file will define the forms used in the Flask application.
# It will be used to handle user input, validate form data, and
# process submissions (e.g., user login, transaction entry).
#
# When we integrate forms, we'll likely use Flask-WTF, a Flask
# extension for creating and validating forms.
#
# Example Forms:
# - UserLoginForm: A form for user login.
# - BudgetForm: A form for creating or editing budget categories.
#
# For now, this is a placeholder until we add form functionality.
